# Build Tool

Version 1.0.0.

This Dyalog class allows the user to automate the export of their application.

The BuildTool is a parameter driven application that will create the export file
whether it be .exe or .dll (or another more exotic type). It'll collect and copy 
additional files or Dyalog .dlls required for your export's functioning. It'll save 
a copy of the workspace (if required) and a variety of other options giving you
complete control of the export process.
